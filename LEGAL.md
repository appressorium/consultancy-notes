+3. There should be liability limitations in here, that limit the type of damages to direct damages and cap damages (say at fees paid). Here is a vanilla example: 
General Limitations.  in no event shall Contractor or its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, subsidiaries, associated companies, and suppliers be liable to Client or any other party for any special, indirect, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages or loss of goodwill or profit in any way arising from or relating to this Agreement or resulting from the use of or inability to use the Custom Software or deliverables or the performance or non-performance of any services, including the failure of essential purpose, even if it or they have been notified of the possibility or likelihood of such damages occurring. Client acknowledges and agrees that the allocation of risks provided in this Agreement are reflected in the fees and other charges provided hereunder and are reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances.

+Cap On Liability.  In no event will Contractor or its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, subsidiaries, associated companies, and suppliers be liable to Client or to any third party, regardless of the form of claim or action, in an aggregate amount that exceeds the fees paid by Client to Contractor.


+4. You give two performance warrantes there, one in Section 5b and one in section 12. I would consolidate, and make it limited in time, like in 12. The warranty should be that the deliverables conform in all materials respects to the specifications in a Project Statement. Also, warranty shouldn't cover any modifications or misuse by client. It's also good to specify a remedy.

+5. There should also be a warranty disclaimer. Here is a vanilla provision:
Disclaimer. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, neither Contractor nor any third party suppliers makes any warranties, representations, conditions, or guaranties, whether express or implied, arising by law, custom, oral or written statements, or otherwise, including but not limited to any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, noninfringement, or of error free and uninterrupted use, all of which are hereby overridden, excluded, and disclaimed in all respects.
